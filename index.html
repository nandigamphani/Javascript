<p id="main-p">“The best Bar-B-Que in the County!” “Or maybe the State.” “Or maybe the whole South!” That’s what folks said about the barbecue Lucille Buchanan grew up eating in her Grandma’s lunch shack, a tiny little nothing of a place on a back road in a small town way outside of Greenville.

                <h3>Baby Back Ribs</h3>
                    <p>The tenderest, meatiest little pork ribs, slow-cooked with sweet hickory smoke, then grilled and basted with our special BBQ sauce. </p> 
                <h3>St. Louis Spare Ribs</h3>
                    <p>Select lean, juicy pork ribs, seasoned with Lucille's special rub, slowly smoked, then grilled and basted with our homemade BBQ sauce. The way they like 'em in Missouri!  </p>
                <h3>BBQ Beef Ribs</h3>
                    <p>Tender, big and meaty beef ribs, spice-rubbed, slowly smoked, then glazed with our BBQ sauce. </p> 
                <h3>Smoked BBQ Half Chicken</h3>
                    <p>Absolute's favorite! Half of a fresh chicken, marinated in our lip smackin' BBQ sauce for 24 hours, slow smoked to perfection and finished on the grill. (The hickory wood smoking process adds a slightly pink color to our chicken)  </p>
                <h3>BBQ Tri Tip</h3>
                    <p>Certified Angus Beef tri tip, smoked all day until it melts in your mouth. Served sliced with our savory mop sauce.   </p> 
                <h3>Absolute's Super Feast</h3>
                    <p>Feed the whole family for less! Choice of three racks of baby back, St. Louis or beef ribs and four half BBQ chickens, with your choice of two pounds of two of the following; sausages, tri tip, pulled pork, rib tips or brisket burnt ends, a large tossed green salad, plus your choice of six sides.
